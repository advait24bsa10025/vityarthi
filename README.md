The Appointment Scheduling System is a Java-based console application designed to simplify the process of managing doctor–patient appointments.  
It enables healthcare clinics to maintain records of doctors, patients, and appointments efficiently.  
The system ensures smooth scheduling while preventing double bookings and offering clear visibility into patient and doctor schedules.

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, packages, encapsulation, and modular design using Java.
