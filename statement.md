##  Problem Statement
Managing appointments in small and medium-sized clinics is often done manually, leading to confusion, double bookings, and inefficiency.  
Doctors and patients face scheduling conflicts, lack of proper record-keeping, and difficulty tracking past or upcoming appointments.  
This project aims to solve these challenges by providing a simple, interactive, and reliable Java-based appointment management system.



## Scope of the Project
The Appointment Scheduling System focuses on:
- Registering and maintaining a list of doctors  
- Registering and managing patient records  
- Booking and canceling appointments  
- Viewing appointments for both doctors and patients  
- Preventing duplicate bookings  
- Providing easy access to healthcare scheduling information  

This system is designed as a console-based application but can be expanded into a GUI or web-based system in future enhancements.



## Target Users
- **Doctors / Clinics** – to maintain schedules and avoid overlapping appointments  
- **Patients** – to book and view appointments easily  
- **Clinic Staff / Receptionists** – to manage daily appointments  
- **Students** – learning OOP concepts and Java application development  



## High-Level Features
- Doctor & patient registration  
- Appointment creation with date & time  
- Prevents conflicts and overlapping appointments  
- View doctor-specific schedules  
- View patient-specific appointment history  
- Appointment cancellation  
- Modular, package-based Java architecture  
- Input validation and error handling
